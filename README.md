Drum kit-
Using: HTML, CSS, advanced Document Object Model (DOM)
Adding sounds with event listeners to buttons and keystrokes to know when user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on particular button on website and animation.
The way this works is getting a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set. and when user click on any of these buttons they will get corresponding sound of the drum.

And as user go from level to level the pattern get more and more complicated, and at some point user going to screw up, and it's going to tell user that it's wrong and game is over. So user can press any key to restart the game.
